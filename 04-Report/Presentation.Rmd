## Objective

Research is tough. Organizing is tough (especially for me). Organizing research is `#@$?&%` tough.

I'm going to share some stuff that has helped me (barely) keep it all together. 

*Feel free to interrupt at any point. My mind is chaotic; why should the presentation be any different?*





## Outline

1. Software
2. Organization
3. Workflow
4. Special Topics





## Software {#blockquote .build}

> If all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. - Abraham Maslow

> It is essential to have good tools, but it is also essential that the tools should be used in the right way. - Wallace D. Wattles

> A good tool improves the way you work. A great tool improves the way you think. - Jeff Duntemann





## Software, cont'd

The programs that I use:

* [R](https://www.r-project.org/) version 4.1.0 Camp Pontanezen
* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/) desktop version 1.4.1106 Tiger Daylily
* [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) version 7.7.2
* [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) 5.0.96.3
  + [ZotFile](http://zotfile.com/)
  + [Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) 
  + [Zotero Connector](https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors)




## Organization {.centered}

## Organization, cont'd

***Directory structure is the key.***

My approach...

* Think about where you would look for a given file and which locations you may access frequently (these should set the upper-level structure)
* Use numbers to order the folders in a way that makes sense (I think of them as building up to a final product)
* Play around with what feels right to you and what would make sense to others (big for collaboration)

* [DZone Data Science Project Folder Structure](https://dzone.com/articles/data-science-project-folder-structure)




## Organization, cont'd

Example *project* directory:

**Intro-R-RStudio-Git**
* 00-Information
* 01-Data
  + 00-Raw-Data
  + 01-Processed-Data
  + 02-Clean-Data
* 02-Scripts
  + 01-Data-Managment-and-Cleaning
  + 02-Exploratory-Analysis
  + 03-Inferential-Analysis
* 03-Output
  + 01-Tables
  + 02-Figures
  + 03-Non-Static
* 04-Report
  + ~~01-Written~~
  + ~~02-Presentation~~
* 05-Miscellaneous





## Workflow

1. Orient goals of project
2. Create GitHub Repo
3. Create R Project
4. Setup Shell Directory
5. Populate Directory
6. Setup Zotero Collection
7. Code, Search, Analyze
8. Recode, Research, Reanalyze...
9. Report
10. Profit ;)




## Workflow, cont'd

***7. Code, Search, Analyze***
***8. Recode, Research, Reanalyze...***

This is where the programs listed before come in handy.

Let's play around and see how everything works...
